## PART A: Discussion Post (70 points)

### Psychology in Your Life

## Instructions

Psychology isn't just an academic subject—it's all around you every day. For this first discussion, you'll explore how psychological principles show up in your own life.

### Part 1: Initial Post (300+ words, 30 points)

Choose ONE of the following psychological principles from Module 1:

**Option A: Confirmation Bias**
- Tendency to seek information that confirms existing beliefs

**Option B: Bystander Effect**
- People are less likely to help when others are present

**Option C: Classical or Operant Conditioning**
- Learning through association or consequences

**Your Task:**
1. **Describe the principle** in your own words (cite textbook)
2. **Share a personal example** from your own life where you've observed this principle in action
3. **Analyze the example** using psychological terminology
4. **Reflect**: Why is understanding this principle useful?

**Example Structure:**
"Confirmation bias is the tendency to... [definition with citation]. I noticed this recently when... [personal example]. This demonstrates confirmation bias because... [psychological analysis]. Understanding this is important because... [reflection]."

### Part 2: Respond to 2 Peers (150+ words each, 10 points each)

Respond to two classmates who chose DIFFERENT principles than you.

**In your responses:**
- Share a connection to their example
- Ask a thoughtful question
- Extend their thinking with an additional insight or example
- Be respectful and constructive

**What makes a good response:**
✓ "I really connected with your example about... This reminds me of when..."
✓ "I'm curious—do you think this principle would apply in [different situation]?"
✓ "Your analysis made me think about how this also relates to..."

❌ Avoid: "Great post!" "I agree." (too brief, not substantive)

## PART B: Portfolio Piece #2 Work - Begin Literature Review (30 points)

While you're working on this discussion, also begin **Piece #2: Literature Review & Hypothesis** for your research portfolio (which will be submitted in Module 3).

**Your Task for This Week:**
1. **Find at least 1-2 empirical research articles** related to your research question from Piece #1
2. **Post a brief update (150+ words)** in this same discussion thread sharing:
   - Article citations (APA format)
   - Brief summary of what each article found
   - How these articles relate to your research question
   - Any questions or challenges you're encountering

**Why This is Part of the Discussion:**
Research is a conversation! Sharing your progress with classmates helps you:
- Get feedback on your article choices
- Discover new research sources from peers
- Practice explaining your research to others
- Build accountability and momentum

**Example Post:**
"For my research on music and memory, I found two relevant articles:

Smith, J., & Jones, M. (2022). The effects of background music on memory recall. *Journal of Cognitive Psychology, 34*(2), 145-162.

This study found that students who studied in silence performed better on memory tests than those with music playing. This relates directly to my research question about whether music helps or hinders studying.

I'm still looking for articles that examine *different types* of music (classical vs. lyrical). Any suggestions?"

## PART A: Discussion Post (70 points)

### Learning Principles in Action

## Instructions

Behavioral principles shape our lives constantly. This discussion asks you to identify these principles in real-world contexts and consider their applications.

### Part 1: Initial Post (350+ words, 30 points)

**Choose ONE scenario:**

**Scenario A: Parenting & Discipline**
Analyze how parents use (or could better use) operant conditioning principles with children. Consider reinforcement vs. punishment, and immediate vs. delayed consequences.

**Scenario B: Classroom Management**
Analyze how teachers use behavioral principles to manage student behavior. Consider token economies, schedules of reinforcement, and extinction.

**Scenario C: Workplace Motivation**
Analyze how employers use conditioning to motivate employees. Consider bonus structures, performance reviews, and workplace culture.

**Scenario D: Personal Habit Change**
Describe a habit you want to change (or have changed) and design a behavior modification plan using operant conditioning principles.

**Your Task:**
1. **Describe your chosen scenario** with specific details
2. **Identify learning principles** at work (positive reinforcement, negative reinforcement, punishment, extinction, schedules of reinforcement, etc.)
3. **Evaluate effectiveness**: What's working well? What's problematic?
4. **Recommend improvements** using psychological research
5. **Support with research**: Cite at least ONE source beyond the textbook (article, study, credible website)

### Part 2: Respond to 2 Peers (150+ words each, 10 points each)

**In your responses:**
- Share an additional behavioral principle they didn't mention
- Offer a different perspective on effectiveness
- Suggest an alternative approach
- Share research that relates to their scenario

## PART B: Portfolio Piece #3 Work - Begin Research Design (30 points)

Continue building your research portfolio by starting **Piece #3: Research Design & Methodology** (due Module 5).

**Your Task for This Week:**
1. **Draft your hypothesis** based on your literature review
2. **Post a brief update (150+ words)** sharing:
   - Your specific, testable hypothesis
   - Planned research method (experimental, correlational, or descriptive)
   - Initial thoughts on participants and procedure
   - Questions or concerns about your design

**Example Post:**
"Based on my literature review, my hypothesis is: Students who study with instrumental music will recall MORE words than students who study in silence, but students who study with lyrical music will recall FEWER words than silence.

I'm planning an experimental design with three groups (silence, instrumental, lyrical) randomly assigned. Each group studies a word list for 10 minutes, then recalls after 24 hours.

My concern: How do I control for prior music preferences? Should I screen participants?"

## Example of Good Analysis

"Many parents use punishment to stop unwanted behaviors, such as taking away screen time when a child misbehaves. While this is negative punishment (removing a pleasant stimulus), research shows it's less effective than positive reinforcement for building desired behaviors (Smith & Jones, 2022). A more effective approach would be to catch the child being good and immediately reinforce positive behaviors with praise or privileges. According to operant conditioning principles, behaviors followed by positive consequences are more likely to increase..."

## Tips for Success
✓ Use specific behavioral terminology correctly
✓ Distinguish between reinforcement (increases behavior) and punishment (decreases)
✓ Consider ethical implications of behavioral control
✓ Find recent research (FTCC library databases)
✓ Include proper citations

## PART A: Discussion Post (70 points)

### Motivation & Well-Being

## Instructions

Understanding what motivates us—and others—is crucial for success in work, relationships, and personal growth. This discussion explores motivation theories and their real-world applications.

### Part 1: Initial Post (350+ words, 30 points)

**Choose ONE motivational challenge:**

**Option A: Academic Motivation**
Why do some students stay motivated while others struggle? Analyze academic motivation using at least TWO theories (e.g., Self-Determination Theory, Goal-Setting Theory, Achievement Motivation).

**Option B: Workplace Motivation**
What motivates people to perform well at work beyond just money? Use motivation theories to explain intrinsic vs. extrinsic motivation in professional settings.

**Option C: Health Behavior Change**
Why is it so hard to maintain healthy habits (exercise, diet, sleep)? Apply motivation theories to explain behavior change challenges and solutions.

**Option D: Social Media Use**
What psychological needs does social media fulfill? Analyze social media motivation using Maslow's Hierarchy and/or Self-Determination Theory.

**Your Task:**
1. **Introduce the motivational challenge** with context/examples

## Example of Theory Application

"According to Self-Determination Theory (Deci & Ryan, 1985), humans have three basic psychological needs: autonomy (feeling in control), competence (feeling capable), and relatedness (feeling connected to others). Many students lose motivation when these needs aren't met. For example, when assignments feel meaningless (low autonomy) or too difficult (low competence) or when students feel isolated (low relatedness), motivation declines. Research by [Current Study] found that students who had choice in assignments and felt connected to peers showed 40% higher engagement..."

## Tips for Success
✓ Go beyond surface-level analysis—dig deep into WHY
✓ Use multiple theories for richer analysis
✓ Include current research (last 5-10 years)
✓ Make it personal and relatable
✓ Consider cultural factors in motivation
✓ Think critically about competing theories

## Instructions

As we conclude PSY-150, reflect on your learning journey and how psychological knowledge will shape your future. This is your opportunity to synthesize what you've learned and consider its lasting impact.

### Part 1: Initial Post (400+ words, 30 points)

**Address all four components:**

**1. Most Surprising or Paradigm-Shifting Concepts (100 words)**
- What psychological concept(s) genuinely surprised you or changed your thinking?
- How did it challenge your prior beliefs or assumptions?
- Give a specific example of how your understanding shifted

**2. Personal Growth & Self-Awareness (100 words)**
- How has this course changed your understanding of yourself?
- What have you learned about your own behavior, thinking, emotions, or relationships?
- Have you made any changes in your life based on course content?

**3. Biopsychosocial Integration (100 words)**
- Choose ONE phenomenon (behavior, disorder, emotion, cognition) and explain it using ALL THREE perspectives:
  - **Biological** factors (brain, neurotransmitters, genetics, hormones)
  - **Psychological** factors (thoughts, emotions, learning, personality)
  - **Social** factors (culture, relationships, environment, norms)
- Demonstrate true integration—show how all three interact

**4. Future Applications (100 words)**
Choose at least TWO domains and explain how you'll apply psychological principles:
- **Career/Professional**: How will psychology help in your field?
- **Relationships**: How will you use psychology to improve relationships?
- **Parenting** (current or future): How will you apply developmental/learning principles?
- **Mental Health**: How will you use this knowledge for your own well-being?
- **Civic Life**: How does psychology inform citizenship, media literacy, voting?
- **Personal Goals**: How will psychology help you achieve your goals?

### Part 2: Respond to 2 Peers (150+ words each, 10 points each)

**In your responses:**
- Connect to a similar learning experience
- Share an additional application they didn't mention
- Offer encouragement and support
- Extend their biopsychosocial analysis
- Make meaningful connections

**Make this personal and authentic.** This is your farewell to classmates—be genuine.

## Grading Rubric (100 points total)

**Initial Post (60 points)**
- Surprising/paradigm-shifting concepts (15 pts)
- Personal growth and self-awareness (15 pts)
- Biopsychosocial integration demonstrated (15 pts)
- Future applications across domains (15 pts)

**Peer Responses (40 points)**
- Response #1: Meaningful connection (20 pts)
- Response #2: Meaningful connection (20 pts)

## Example of Biopsychosocial Integration

"Depression provides a powerful example of biopsychosocial integration. **Biologically**, depression involves reduced serotonin and norepinephrine, smaller hippocampus volume, and genetic predisposition (perhaps 40% heritable). **Psychologically**, negative thinking patterns (cognitive distortions), learned helplessness, and rumination maintain depressive symptoms. **Socially**, lack of social support, cultural stigma preventing treatment-seeking, stressful life events, and socioeconomic factors contribute. These factors interact: biological vulnerability + psychological stress + social isolation create a vicious cycle. Effective treatment must address all three levels—medication (biological), therapy (psychological), and social support (social)—which is why combined treatments work best."

## Tips for Success
✓ Be honest and reflective—this isn't about "right answers"
✓ Use specific examples from course content
✓ Demonstrate growth over the semester
✓ Show depth in your biopsychosocial analysis
✓ Be forward-thinking about applications
✓ Use psychological terminology accurately
✓ Make it meaningful—this is YOUR learning story
