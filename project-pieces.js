        instructions: `# PORTFOLIO PIECE #1: Research Question & Method Selection

## Overview
Choose a psychological phenomenon that interests you and develop a researchable question. This is the foundation of your semester-long investigation project.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Choose Your Topic
Select a psychological phenomenon from any area covered in this course:
- **Research Methods** (Module 1): Ethics, validity, reliability
- **Biopsychology** (Module 2): Brain, neurotransmitters, genetics
- **Learning & Memory** (Module 3): Conditioning, memory processes
- **Cognition & Development** (Module 4): Intelligence, cognitive biases, lifespan development
- **Motivation & Emotion** (Module 5): Theories of motivation, emotional regulation
- **Personality & Social** (Module 6): Traits, social influence, conformity
- **Disorders & Treatment** (Module 7): Mental health, therapeutic approaches

### Step 2: Develop Your Research Question
Write a specific, measurable, researchable question. Your question should:
- Be **specific** (not "How does stress affect people?" but "How does academic stress affect college students' sleep quality?")
- Be **measurable** (involves variables you could actually measure)
- Be **ethical** (could be conducted without harming participants)
- Be **focused** (narrow enough to investigate thoroughly)

**Examples of GOOD research questions:**
- "Does listening to music while studying affect memory recall in college students?"
- "How does social media use correlate with anxiety levels in young adults?"
- "Are there gender differences in conformity behavior in group settings?"

### Step 3: Identify Your Research Method
Choose the most appropriate research method for your question:

**EXPERIMENTAL:** Manipulate an independent variable, measure dependent variable, establish cause-effect
- Example: Randomly assign students to study with music vs. silence, measure test scores

**CORRELATIONAL:** Measure two variables, examine relationship (no causation)
- Example: Survey social media use hours and anxiety levels, calculate correlation

**DESCRIPTIVE:** Observe/survey to describe behavior patterns
- Examples: Case study, naturalistic observation, survey

### Step 4: Justify Your Choice
Explain WHY your chosen method is appropriate:
- What are the advantages of this method for your question?
- What are the limitations?
- Could another method work? Why did you choose this one?

## What to Submit for Piece #1

**Create a document (1-2 pages) that includes:**

1. **Research Topic** (1 paragraph)
   - What psychological phenomenon are you investigating?
   - Why is this interesting/important?

2. **Research Question** (1-2 sentences)
   - Your specific, measurable research question

3. **Research Method** (1 paragraph)
   - Which method will you use? (Experimental, Correlational, or Descriptive)
   - If experimental: What is your IV and DV?
   - If correlational: What two variables will you measure?
   - If descriptive: What will you observe/survey?

4. **Method Justification** (1 paragraph)
   - Why is this method appropriate for your question?
   - What are the advantages and limitations?

5. **Ethical Considerations** (1 paragraph)
   - How will you protect participants?
   - Will you need informed consent?
   - Are there any risks?

## Grading Criteria (50 points)

- **Research Question Quality** (15 pts): Specific, measurable, researchable, focused
- **Method Selection** (15 pts): Appropriate method for question, clearly described
- **Justification** (10 pts): Thoughtful reasoning about method choice

        dueDate: "Module 3 submission",
        instructions: `# PORTFOLIO PIECE #2: Literature Review

## Overview
Research what psychologists have already discovered about your topic. Find and summarize 3 empirical research articles related to your research question.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Find 3 Empirical Research Articles
**Where to search:**
- FTCC Library databases (PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES)
- Google Scholar
- OpenStax Psychology references

**What to look for:**
- **Empirical articles** (actual research studies with methods and results, NOT review articles or opinion pieces)
- **Peer-reviewed** (published in academic journals)
- **Related to your topic** (even if not identical to your question)
- **Recent** (prefer articles from last 10 years when possible)

### Step 2: Read and Summarize Each Article
For each of the 3 articles, write a summary (1 paragraph each) that includes:

**Required Information:**
1. **Citation** (APA format)
2. **Purpose**: What did the researchers want to find out?
3. **Method**: Who were the participants? What did researchers do?
4. **Results**: What did they find?
5. **Relevance**: How does this relate to YOUR research question?

### Step 3: Synthesize the Literature
After summarizing all 3 articles, write a synthesis paragraph that:
- Identifies common themes or patterns across the studies
- Points out contradictions or disagreements
- Explains what we still don't know (the gap your study could fill)

### Step 4: Refine Your Research Question
Based on what you learned, revise your research question if needed to:
- Make it more specific
- Align with existing research
- Fill a gap in the literature

## What to Submit for Piece #2

**Create a document (2-3 pages) that includes:**

1. **Updated Research Question**
   - Your refined research question from Piece #1

2. **Article Summaries** (3 paragraphs, one per article)
   - Full APA citation
   - Purpose, Method, Results for each study
   - Relevance to your question

3. **Literature Synthesis** (1-2 paragraphs)
   - What do these studies tell us overall?
   - What patterns emerge?
   - What questions remain unanswered?

4. **References** (separate page)
   - All 3 articles in APA format

## Grading Criteria (50 points)

- **Article Quality & Relevance** (15 pts): 3 appropriate empirical articles from credible sources
- **Summary Accuracy** (15 pts): Correctly identifies purpose, method, results for each study
- **Synthesis** (10 pts): Identifies patterns, gaps, and connections across articles
- **APA Citations** (5 pts): Proper APA format for in-text and reference citations
- **Writing Quality** (5 pts): Clear, organized, professional

## Tips for Success
✓ Start with FTCC library databases—they have full-text access
✓ Use keywords from your research question to search
✓ Read the abstract first to see if article is relevant
✓ Focus on the "Introduction" and "Discussion" sections to understand context
✓ Take notes as you read—don't try to remember everything
✓ Use citation generators (like Citation Machine) for APA format help

## Example Article Summary Format

**Citation:**
Smith, J., & Jones, M. (2022). The effects of sleep deprivation on memory consolidation in college students. *Journal of Cognitive Psychology, 34*(2), 145-162. https://doi.org/10.1037/example

**Summary:**
Smith and Jones (2022) investigated whether sleep deprivation affects memory consolidation in college students. They recruited 60 undergraduate students and randomly assigned them to either a normal sleep condition (8 hours) or sleep deprivation condition (4 hours or less). All participants studied word lists and were tested 24 hours later. Results showed that sleep-deprived students recalled significantly fewer words (M = 42%) compared to the normal sleep group (M = 68%), t(58) = 4.32, p < .001. This study is relevant to my research question about academic stress and sleep because it demonstrates that reduced sleep directly impairs memory, which could explain why stressed students (who often sleep less) perform poorly on exams.
