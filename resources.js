                content: `**Red Flags for Pseudoscience**:

🚩 Claims sound too good to be true
🚩 "Miracle cure" or "one weird trick" language
🚩 Relies on anecdotes/testimonials instead of research
🚩 Cherry-picks evidence, ignores contradictory findings
🚩 Uses scientific-sounding jargon incorrectly
🚩 No peer-reviewed research supporting claims
🚩 Promotes single cause for complex problems
🚩 Refuses to acknowledge limitations
🚩 Appeals to ancient wisdom rather than modern science
🚩 Claims mainstream science is conspiring against them

**Questions to Ask**:
- What evidence supports this claim?
- Has this been tested scientifically?
- What's the quality of the research?
- Are there alternative explanations?
- What do experts in the field say?
- Could this be correlation mistaken for causation?
- Are there conflicts of interest (selling a product)?

**Examples of Debunked Psychology Myths**:
- Left-brain/right-brain learning styles
- We only use 10% of our brain
- Subliminal messages control behavior
- Violent video games cause aggression (evidence is mixed)
- Learning styles (visual, auditory, kinesthetic) matching improves learning
- Lie detectors are reliable
- Birth order determines personality`

- 1 in 5 adults experiences mental illness each year
- Mental health conditions are medical conditions (not character flaws)
- Treatment works - most people improve with proper care
- Mental illness does not discriminate (affects all ages, races, incomes)
- Recovery is possible

**How to Be an Ally**:
- Use person-first language ("person with depression" not "depressed person")
- Avoid stigmatizing terms ("crazy," "psycho," "schizo")
- Listen without judgment
- Validate feelings ("That sounds really difficult")
- Ask how you can support
- Educate yourself about mental health
- Speak up against stigma
- Share resources when appropriate

**If a Friend is Struggling**:
1. Express concern ("I've noticed you seem down lately")
2. Listen without trying to "fix" everything
3. Validate their feelings
4. Encourage professional help
5. Offer specific support ("Can I go with you to counseling?")
6. Follow up - check in regularly
7. Take care of yourself too

**Remember**: You are not a therapist, but you can be a supportive friend. It's okay to encourage someone to get professional help.`

                content: `**What the Research Shows**:

**✅ Effective Study Strategies**:

**1. Spaced Practice (Spacing Effect)**
- Study material over multiple sessions
- Better than cramming in one long session
- Review periodically after initial learning
- Example: Study 30 min/day for 5 days vs 2.5 hours in one day

**2. Retrieval Practice (Testing Effect)**
- Quiz yourself repeatedly
- Don't just reread notes
- Use flashcards, practice questions, self-testing
- Struggle to recall = better retention

**3. Elaboration**
- Explain concepts in your own words
- Connect new information to what you know
- Ask "Why?" and "How?"
- Teach material to someone else

**4. Interleaving**
- Mix different topics while studying
- Don't study one topic until "mastered," then move on
- Alternate between topics
- Example: Study brain structures, then conditioning, then back to brain

**5. Concrete Examples**
- Use specific, vivid examples
- Create your own examples
- Apply abstract concepts to real situations
- Connect to personal experiences

**❌ Ineffective Strategies** (feel like they work but don't):
- Highlighting or rereading (passive)
- Cramming the night before
- Studying same material repeatedly without testing
- Multitasking while studying`

**Tips**:
- Schedule specific study times (treat like appointments)

- Build in buffer time for unexpected events
- Review material within 24 hours of class/reading

**Breaking Down Large Assignments**:

Example: Written Assignment due in 2 weeks

- Day 3-4: Research and gather sources
- Day 5-7: Create outline
- Day 8-10: Write rough draft
- Day 11-12: Revise and edit
- Day 13: Proofread and submit

**Managing Test Anxiety**:
- Arrive early, settle in
- Take deep breaths (physiological calming)
- Positive self-talk ("I've prepared," "I know this")
- Focus on one question at a time
- If panicking, take a brief mental break
- Remember: One test doesn't define you

**After the Test**:
- Review feedback (Canvas often explains correct answers)
- Identify knowledge gaps
- Adjust study strategies if needed
- Don't dwell on what you can't change
- Focus on learning, not just grades`
