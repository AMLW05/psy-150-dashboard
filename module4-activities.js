Create an original project that demonstrates your understanding of concepts from Modules 1-3 (Research Methods, Biopsychology, Learning & Memory).

**Choose ONE option:**

**Option A: AI-Generated Song**
- Use AI (Suno, etc.) to create a song incorporating at least 3 concepts from each module
- Include lyrics that accurately represent psychological principles
- Submit: Audio file + lyrics document explaining which concepts are included

**Option B: Infographic Poster**
- Create visual infographic connecting concepts across modules
- Must include: research methods, brain structures/functions, learning principles, memory processes
- Use Canva, PowerPoint, or similar tool

**Option C: Video Explainer (3-5 minutes)**
- Record yourself explaining how the three modules connect
- Use specific examples and accurate terminology
- Can use slides, props, or demonstrations

**All options must:**
- Accurately represent psychological concepts
- Include concepts from ALL THREE modules (1, 2, 3)
- Show connections between topics
- Demonstrate understanding, not just memorization
