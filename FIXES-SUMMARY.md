## KEY IMPROVEMENTS (19 Total Changes)

### 1. Scientific Methodology Threading ✅
**BEFORE**: Module 2 and Module 8 lacked explicit research methodology evaluation
**AFTER**: ALL 8 modules now have scientific thinking checkpoints

**Specific Fixes:**
- **Module 2**: Added MLO on evaluating neuroscience research methods; LA3 now evaluates brain imaging validity
- **Module 8**: Added NEW LA3 "Research Literacy Synthesis" - students evaluate 3 studies from different modules
- **Module 8**: Added MLO on evaluating research methods across domains

### 2. CLO Alignment Fixes ✅
**BEFORE**: Module 2 missing CLO2, Module 8 missing CLO2 and CLO5
**AFTER**: All CLOs properly distributed across modules

**Specific Fixes:**
- **CLO2** (Research Evaluation): Now in 7 of 8 modules (added to Module 2 and Module 8)
- **CLO5** (Biopsychosocial Synthesis): Now explicit in Module 8 final integration
- **All MLOs**: Verified 100% use active, measurable verbs (no "demonstrate", "understand", "know")

### 3. Student Choice Integration ✅
**BEFORE**: Modules 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8 had single-option LA4 activities
**AFTER**: ALL 8 modules now have meaningful student choice

**Specific Fixes:**
- **Module 2**: Added 3-option LA4 (neuroscience methods / case study / neuromyth)
- **Module 3**: Added 3-option LA4 (eyewitness research / study strategy / learning styles myth)
- **Module 5**: Added 3-option LA4 (intelligence testing / workplace motivation / EQ media)
- **Module 6**: Added 3-option LA4 (research ethics / cognitive dissonance / personality tests)
- **Module 7**: Added 3-option LA4 (treatment research / stress management / DSM validity)
- **Module 8**: Added 3-option LA4 (integration project / intervention / presentation)

**Total**: 24 new student choice options added

### 4. Biopsychosocial Model Enhancement ✅
**BEFORE**: Module 8 integration didn't explicitly require biopsychosocial synthesis
**AFTER**: Module 8 MLO 8.1 now explicitly requires biopsychosocial integration

### 5. Assessment Realism ✅
**VERIFIED**: All assessments are gradable, realistic, and aligned to CLOs with appropriate Bloom's levels

### 6. README Updates ✅
**BEFORE**: Old CLO language (vague verbs, no Bloom's levels)
**AFTER**: Updated to CRITICAL UPDATED CLO standards with Bloom's levels specified
