## 🎯 Critical Quality Issue - RESOLVED

**Original Problem**: All 236 questions were written as unprofessional sentence fragments:
- ❌ "This is:"
- ❌ "Patient has damage to Broca's area. Most likely symptom:"
- ❌ "Freud's psychosexual stages emphasize:"

**Solution Implemented**: Complete systematic rewrite of every question to professional standards:
- ✅ "How should this be evaluated ethically?"
- ✅ "A patient has sustained damage to Broca's area in the frontal lobe. Which symptom would this patient most likely exhibit?"
- ✅ "Freud's theory of psychosexual stages emphasizes which factor in personality development?"
